# Connect 4 and portfolio

Connect 4 is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid In this case, you are the player who is facing GPT (A.I.).

The human player starts with a red yellow disc. GPT starts with a yellow. Drop discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack your colored discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Use strategy to block GPT while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win!

The client-side uses react.js, the server uses express.js and I use chat-gpt to make api calls to openai in order to face an A.I. opponent!
