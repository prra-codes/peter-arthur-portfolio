# Connect 4 and portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website code which also has Connect 4!

Connect 4 is a classic strategy game in which 2 players go head-to-head in a battle to own the grid!

Players start with a red or yellow disc. They drop the discs into the grid, starting in the middle or at the edge to stack their colored discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Use strategy to block opponents while aiming to be the first player to get 4 in a row to win!

The client-side uses react.js, the server uses express.js and I use chat-gpt to make api calls to openai in order to face an A.I. opponent!
